      "description": "ChatGPT For Dummies demystifies the artificial intelligence tool that can answer questions, write essays, and generate just about any kind of text it's asked for. This powerful example of generative AI is widely predicted to upend education and business. In this book, you'll learn how ChatGPT works and how you can operate it in a way that yields satisfactory results. You'll also explore the ethics of using AI-generated content for various purposes. Written by a journalist who's been on the front lines of artificial intelligence for over a decade, this book dives deep into ChatGPT's potential, so you can make informed decisions--without asking ChatGPT for help.",

Educators are concerned that students could use this technology to write papers - the tool wasn't even a month old when a college professor in South Carolina caught a student using it to write an essay in philosophy class. Darren Hick of Furman University joins John Yang to discuss.",

      "description": "In the first half of 2023, text-generative artificial intelligence (AI), including ChatGPT from OpenAI, has attracted considerable attention worldwide. In this study, first, we compared Japanese stylometric features of texts generated by ChatGPT, equipped with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and those written by humans. In this work, we performed multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to confirm the distributions of 216 texts of three classes (72 academic papers written by 36 single authors, 72 texts generated by GPT-3.5, and 72 texts generated by GPT-4 on the basis of the titles of the aforementioned papers) focusing on the following stylometric features: (1) bigrams of parts-of-speech, (2) bigram of postpositional particle words, (3) positioning of commas, and (4) rate of function words. MDS revealed distinct distributions at each stylometric feature of GPT (3.5 and 4) and human. Although GPT-4 is more powerful than GPT-3.5 because it has more parameters, both GPT (3.5 and 4) distributions are overlapping. These results indicate that although the number of parameters may increase in the future, GPT-generated texts may not be close to that written by humans in terms of stylometric features. Second, we verified the classification performance of random forest (RF) classifier for two classes (GPT and human) focusing on Japanese stylometric features. This study revealed the high performance of RF in each stylometric feature: The RF classifier focusing on the rate of function words achieved 98.1% accuracy. Furthermore the RF classifier focusing on all stylometric features reached 100% in terms of all performance indexes (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score). This study concluded that at this stage we human discriminate ChatGPT from human limited to Japanese language.",

      "description": "Conversational AI is a game-changer for science. Since a chatbot called ChatGPT was released late last year, it has become apparent that this type of artificial intelligence (AI) technology will have huge implications on the way in which researchers work. ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM), a machine-learning system that autonomously learns from data and can produce sophisticated and seemingly intelligent writing after training on a massive data set of text. To prevent human automation bias - an over-reliance on automated systems - it will become even more crucial to emphasize the importance of accountability8. In the future, LLMs are likely to be incorporated into text processing and editing tools, search engines and programming tools. [...]they might contribute to scientific work without authors necessarily being aware of the nature or magnitude of the contributions.",

      "description": "In less than 2 months, the artificial intelligence (AI) program ChatGPT has become a cultural sensation. It is freely accessible through a web portal created by the tool's developer, OpenAI. The program-which automatically creates text based on written prompts-is so popular that it's likely to be \"at capacity right now\" if you attempt to use it. When you do get through, ChatGPT provides endless entertainment. I asked it to rewrite the first scene of the classic American play\n, but to feature Princess Elsa from the animated movie\nas the main character instead of Willy Loman. The output was an amusing conversation in which Elsa-who has come home from a tough day of selling-is told by her son Happy, \"Come on, Mom. You're Elsa from\n. You have ice powers and you're a queen. You're unstoppable.\" Mash-ups like this are certainly fun, but there are serious implications for generative AI programs like ChatGPT in science and academia.",

      "description": "Publishers and preprint servers contacted by Nature's news team agree that AIs such as ChatGPT do not fulfil the criteria for a study author, because they cannot take responsibility for the content and integrity of scientific papers. (Victor Tseng, the preprint's corresponding author and medical director of Ansible Health in Mountain View, California, did not respond to a request for comment.) An editorial2 in the journal Nurse Education in Practice this month credits the AI as a co-author, alongside Siobhan O'Connor, a health-technology researcher at the University of Manchester, UK. The board of the physical-sciences preprint server arXiv has had internal discussions and is beginning to converge on an approach to the use of generative AIs, says scientific director Steinn Sigurdsson, an astronomer at Pennsylvania State University in University Park.",

[...]a group led by Catherine Gao at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, has used ChatGPT to generate artificial research-paper abstracts to test whether scientists can spot them.
